# BIDS-MATLAB
BIDS Creator from MRI raw data 
Davide Aloi - PhD student University of Birmingham
A series of script that can help you to convert a fMRI raw dataset to BIDS.

INPUT
RAW data should be organised as following:
Experiment folder
    Subject folder (C01,02,03 etc).
        Condition folder (C01_SessionConditionName)
            DICOM folder (if present)
                DICOM files' names are not important BUT they should have at
                 the header SeriesDescription containing a string that
                 identify the series (e.g. fMRI_joystick_pre or T1_VOL)
            or
            NIFTI files containing the SeriesConditionName in their name
            (e.g. sub-02_task-fMRIjoystickPre_bold.nii)
            nb BIDS does't allow underscores in the task name (e.g.
            fMRI_joystick_pre must be fMRIjoystickPre). This is the reason
            why we will define 2 different variables: series_descriptions
            (which must be equal to the one contained in DICOM headers or
             in the name of the files .nii in your raw dataset)
            and series_bids_labels, which should not have underscores.
     ...

OUTPUT
RAW DICOM files are converted to nifty and a JSON sidecar files are created.
The name of the file is created by reading the header "SeriesDescription"
of the DICOM file and using the relative label defined in the
variable series_bids_labels.
 E.g. sub-01_ses-SesName_task-TaskName.nii and
 sub-01_ses-SesName_task-TaskName.json.

Alternatively, if files were already converted (in this case there should
not be DICOM folders within the subject folders otherwise the script will
convert the DICOM files within these folders instead of using the nifti
files), the script will look for nifti files containing the condition name
within their names.
e.g. if the condition is fMRI_tdcs_pre, the nifti file should be:
XXXXX_fMRI_tdcs_pre_XXXXXX.nifti

Note: When a dicom folder is not present the script presumes that DICOM files
have already been converted to nifti and it will look for .nii files. In
this case the script will have to write a Json sidecar file. You should
therefore insert the information that you want to have in your json
sidecar file in the script block named "Create Sidecar JSon Document" below.
The dataset is then organised according to the bids standard as following:
Experiment folder (README,CHANGES,participants.tsv,dataset_description.json).
    Subj-number
        Ses (ses-sesName)
            Subj-number.tsv (not in the script)
                anat
                sub-n_ses-SesName_T1w.nii
                sub-n_ses-SesName_T1w.json
                func
                    sub-n_ses-SesName_task-TaskName.json
                    sub-n_ses-SesName_task-TaskName.nii
    ...
