BIDS-MATLAB - Davide Aloi, PhD student, University of Birmingham

This is a collection of scripts that can help you building and working on a BIDS dataset on Matlab.

1) RawToMatlab: this script builds a BIDS dataset starting from a raw dataset.
2) Double-Blinder: this script assignes new labels to your bids dataset.
3) JsonFixer: this script iterate all the json files of your BIDS dataset and can change/add new lines in case something is missing
or a mistake was made during the creation of the bids dataset.
4) NiiHeaderFixer: this script iterate all the .nii files of your dataset and can change specific values in the header. It
can be helpful in case there is a wrong value in the headers (e.g. a repetition time set to 0)
